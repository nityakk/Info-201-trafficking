# Info-201-Final-Project

Purpose: 
The goal of our project is to examine and compare different aspects of child labor. We want to answer questions and find trends on why child labor occurs. The three questions that we would like to answer are: 
1. Which locations have the worst child labor?
2. What are the exploitation types around the area?
3. Change in labor rate between two different time periods


The dataset we will be working with is Sweat and Toil. This data comes from the United States Department of Labor’s (ILAB) three flagship reports: “Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor”, “List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor”, and “List of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Labor”.  ILAB’s mission is to enforce trade commitments, strengthen labor standards, and combat international child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking. This dataset was accessed through the United States Department of Labor Developer Portal. It includes 14 tables containing data from 2015 to 2017 which has information on countries, regions, territories, advancement levels, sectors, goods, statistics, conventions, suggested actions, legal standards, enforcements, and mechanisms.
